# **Branching**
-Project 5 will inherit a branch from project 2


# **The use of a .gitignore file within each project**

When I commit a project to the GitHub repository, Git is instructed by the **gitignore** file which files to ignore. This means that the repository will correspond with the correct project.For example Project 1 repository will be committed to project one therefore it wont interfere with other project that it did not commit to.
